Here’s a sample README.md file for your React authentication app with signup, login, and security best practices.

React Authentication App

A simple React application that allows users to sign up, log in, and securely interact with an API for authentication. This app integrates best practices for handling sensitive information, such as passwords, and uses secure HTTP methods for communication with the API.

Features
	•	Signup Page: Allows users to create a new account with email, password, and invite code.
	•	Login Page: Users can log in with their email and password.
	•	API Integration: Connects to a backend API for authentication (signup and login).
	•	Error Handling: Displays error messages for validation and API errors.
	•	Security Best Practices: Uses HTTPS, secure HTTP headers, and JWT token authentication.

Technologies Used
	•	React
	•	Axios (for API integration)
	•	Material-UI (for the UI components)
	•	CSS (for styling)
	•	JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication

Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Node.js (version 14 or higher)
	•	npm (Node package manager)
	•	An API backend to handle signup and login (API base URL: https://bffapi.biztel.ai:8080/api/auth)

Setup and Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-auth-app.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd react-auth-app


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

npm install


	4.	Create an .env file at the root of the project and add your API base URL:

REACT_APP_API_URL=https://bffapi.biztel.ai:8080/api/auth


	5.	Start the development server:

npm start

This will run the app locally at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works

1. Signup Flow:
	•	Users can fill in the Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, and Invite Code fields.
	•	On form submission, the app validates the fields and sends a POST request to the API’s /signup endpoint.
	•	If successful, a message will indicate that the user is successfully signed up.

2. Login Flow:
	•	Users can log in by entering their Email and Password.
	•	Upon successful login, the backend returns a JWT token.
	•	This JWT token is stored in a httpOnly cookie for secure handling.

3. API Integration:
	•	The app uses Axios for sending requests to the backend API.
	•	The API responds with success or error messages, and the app updates the UI accordingly.
	•	All requests to the API are made over HTTPS to ensure security.

4. Security:
	•	Passwords are never stored or exposed in plaintext.
	•	The app uses secure HTTP headers, such as Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options, to prevent various attacks.
	•	The JWT token is stored in a secure, httpOnly cookie to prevent XSS attacks.
	•	The app makes sure to interact with the API over HTTPS to prevent MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.

Error Handling
	•	Form validation errors are displayed if any required fields are missing or incorrect.
	•	API errors (such as incorrect credentials or server errors) are shown in the UI.

Security Best Practices
	1.	Use HTTPS: All API requests are made over HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted during transmission.
	2.	Secure Password Storage: Passwords are never stored on the client side in localStorage or sessionStorage.
	3.	JWT Authentication: After successful login, the app stores the JWT token in a secure, httpOnly cookie.
	4.	CSRF Protection: Use the SameSite attribute for cookies and consider implementing CSRF tokens.
	5.	Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Restrict where resources can be loaded from to prevent malicious code execution.

Known Issues
	•	None currently. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
